Can Add .gitignore file => Git Track .gitignore file but files mentioned in .gitignore file will be ignored OR Not Pushed Will Always stay on local e.g .gitignore => .env, text5.txt, abc.md

If Need An Empty Folder But git dont track empty folder so use .gitkeep file inside of it to track empty folder.

Go to .git folder and checkout to the HEAD file

SSH generated by System will be passed to Github one time, So every push will carry SSH and github verify that SSH.
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
If Use passphrase then (when git clone, git push, etc) its ask for that ssh passwoord.
Put that public ssh in github

Clone 2. shh => No Need for authentication may ask passphrase if used in generating sshd. Better If Frequent Use.
